The purpose is to demonstrate the use of angular ng-template to help generate html code that can be used outside of angular, e.g. rendering content in another tab, or sending to a server.
I failed to be able to do so. Only the static content is captured by the process.
Therefore this repository is the study of how to propoerly do it.
